# Inferno-OS
The goal of this project was to implement the `mmap()` system call and install Inferno OS in a virtual machine.
I attempted to use VirtualBox to clone and build Inferno OS from GitHub on Ubuntu, however the installation was unsuccessful because of missing files and build issues.
Due to these problems, I switched to Ubuntu and tested the `mmap()` system call.
My comprehension of system call implementation and OS installation difficulties has improved as a result of this effort.
